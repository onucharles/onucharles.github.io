I conduct my research at the intersection of artificial intelligence and healthcare at [Mila](https://mila.quebec/en/person/charles-c-onu/) and the [Reasoning and Learning (RL) lab](http://rl.cs.mcgill.ca/index.html), McGill University. My supervisor is [Prof. Doina Precup](https://mila.quebec/en/person/doina-precup/), co-director of RL lab and director of the DeepMind lab in Montreal. The overarching theme guiding my work is advancing machine learning to positively impact healthcare. Specific areas I work on include classical ML, deep learning, speech, physiological signal processing and tensor decomposition techniques. I hold a [Vanier](https://vanier.gc.ca/) Canada Graduate Scholarship.

I founded and lead AI Research at [Ubenwa](http://ubenwa.ai/). The Ubenwa project is aimed at developing cry-based, low-cost tools for early diagnosis of conditions that affect the central and autonomic nervous systems in newborns. Our work is funded by generous grants from Mila, Ministère de l’Économie et d'Innovation ([MEI](https://www.economie.gouv.qc.ca/en/)) du Québec, [District 3](http://d3center.ca/) Innovation Centre, and [MIT Solve](https://solve.mit.edu/).
